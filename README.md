## üìñ About
**Problem**: Binary classification with the aim of predicting risky credit operations.

In this particularly case I classified **if a credit applicant is creditworthy** analyizing its personal and  financial data to predict if is going to repay a loan on time. It is considered that an applicant have defaulted on its debt if it does not pay within 60 days of the due date so in this case will label with 0 those that are solvent and with 1 those that are not.

**Industries**: fintech, banks, insurtech, many others related. 

**Solution**:
Predict whether a person applying for a home credit will be able to repay their debt or not. Data pre-processing for a large dataset of +350,000 transactions. Trained many supervised models achieving +0.72 ROC AUC. Models used where DecisionTree, XGBoost and LightGBM.

You can see the whole project in the following **notebook**:
 - [Home credit default risk](https://github.com/agusle/home-credit-risk-analysis/blob/main/home-credit-default-risk.ipynb)
